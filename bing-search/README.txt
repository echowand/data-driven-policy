** to run the java code, you will need to add the json-simple jar to your classpath.

export CLASSPATH=/homes/du25/summer_research/bing\ search/json-simple-1.1.jar 


the code is set up to simply print out the results to a query. i have not yet set ways to create complex queries 
(restricting search space, result set size, etc), since i do not yet know exactly how the piece will be used.
